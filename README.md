# Tableau_Netflix_Movies

Netflix Movies and TV Shows
About this Dataset: Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

This is my first project using Tableau so I am getting items such as:
1. How many movies exist in the dataset per category
2.
3.
4.
5.
